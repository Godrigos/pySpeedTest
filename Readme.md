# pySpeedTest
A small [Python](https://www.python.org/) project to execute Ookla's Speedtest&trade; CLI and append the results in a Tab-separated values file (.csv)

It uses [speedtest-cli](https://www.speedtest.net/apps/cli) version 1.2.0 for x86_64 Linux machines to test the speed and performance of your internet connection.

## DESCRIPTION
**pySpeedTest** is an application that measures the latency, jitter, packet loss, download bandwidth, and
upload bandwidth of the network connection between the client and a nearby Speedtest&trade;
Server.
